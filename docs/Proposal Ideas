IDEA: Creating a Spotify playlist based on the sentiment scores by detecting tweet sentiment.

Description: The goal of this project is to allow users to obtain a customized spotify playlist based on their most recent mood. We will use Spotify and 
Twitter APIs to pull the data, and then use a sentiment analysis API to inspect their tweets and songs, and calculate specific sentiment scores. 
By comparing sentiment scores of tweets and songs, we will be able to match the song and users’ mood.

Language: 
Front-end: Javascript with REACT, HTML/CSS
Back-end: Python with Flask framework
Database: MongoDB or SQLite or MySQL

Utilizing a database: The database can store the users’ information, recommended songs, and detected tweets.

Two Public APIs: Spotify API, Twitter API, Google NLP

Third Party Authorization: OAuth



IDEA: Creating a web application to curate a list of ingredients from the nearest grocery stores for a certain meal picked by the user. 

Description: The goal of this project is to allow users to pick a recipe or meal they want to cook, and obtain a list of ingredients and their prices 
from the grocery stores that are near the user’s location.

Language: 
Front-end: Javascript with REACT, HTML/CSS. Will use Express.js framework for front-end 
Back-end: Python with Flask framework. 
Database: MySQL or MongoDB

Utilizing a database: Once creating an account, the user can enter information such as preferred grocery stores, food they already have at home, and 
allergies. 

Two Public APIs: We can use an API to find grocery stores near the user’s location, and another API to determine which food items or products of interest 
are being sold there. We will also use a recipe API to determine what other ingredients the user needs. 
#Also we can use another api to see the costs of the produce/groceries we are looking to find.
