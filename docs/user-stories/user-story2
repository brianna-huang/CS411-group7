As a logged-in user, I want to be able to search for ingredients I have at home so that I can add them to my online food pantry.

Description: Refer to user login story for how user logs in to website. Once a user is logged in, they will click on the food pantry 
part of the website. This will take them to a page in which they can see any existing ingredients theyâ€™ve added to their pantry and 
also search for new ingredients. To search for new ingredients, they type in the name of the ingredient into the search bar and they 
will be able to select the same or a similar ingredient to the one they searched for and add it to the pantry.
