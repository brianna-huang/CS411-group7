The languages we are using for the website design are HTML and CSS which we chose because of the numerous features and elements they allow us to 
include in our website. In order for the front-end to communicate with the back-end, we are using Javascript and React.js. We chose to use React.js 
over Angular.js because React.js is a better library/framework to use to curate an accessible website for users to interact with. In the back-end, 
we chose to use Python with the Flask framework. We chose to use Flask over Django because Flask is flexible, easy to use, and is very well-documented. 
Flask also makes it very smooth and easy to include APIs in our application. Django does overall have more features and is helpful for creating more 
complex projects but for the scope of this project, because it is small-scale, easy-to-use, and also because several members of our team are familiar 
with Flask, we believe that Flask is the better choice.
